Code definition - 

IMMEDIATE word - A word that has the IMMEDIATE bit set in its dictionary
    header. Is executed during interpretation. Is executed during 
    compilation rather than compiled into a definition.


Machine-code word - A word that is directly executed by the CPU. Does not 
    call other Forth words. May exit via a jump instruction to the 
    address of NEXT or by including the contents of NEXT inline, thereby 
    avoiding a jump instruction. Examples include the words NEXT EXECUTE 
    BRANCH and EXIT .


Threaded-code word - A word that contains other Forth words. May also 
    contain machine-code words. Exits by calling the Forth word ; .



Dictionary
===================

;  "Semi-colon"
Terminates a definition created by : .

1. Exits colon definition mode
2. Addes the definition to the dictionary
3. Enters interpretation mode

    : ; ( -- )
        ( definition goes here ) ;


NEXT  "Next"
Terminates a code-word and jumps to the next instruction.

1. Fetch the Code Field Address (CFA),
   which is stored in a cell,
   which is pointed to by the Forth Instruction Pointer (IP)
2. Increment the Forth IP,
   which will then point to the proceeding cell,
   which contains the next Forth instruction
3. Jump to the fetched CFA

    : NEXT ( -- )
        RS> ,>PC ,R--


Notes:
   - What is a cell? I think this is address of the code field of the
   proceeding Forth word. The IP always points to the next CFA to be
   executed.
   - Does the cell located at the CFA hold a machine instruction or
   is there a Forth dictionary word there? I think the contents of the
   cell pointed to by the CFA in the IP is always a machine instruction.
   I think the word INTERPRET handles the task of looking through the
   dictionary and determining the CFA of that word. The CFA should be
   the first cell of a word's code field, which can be one or more cells.
