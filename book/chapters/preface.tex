This is the preface page. This book is broken into two parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Hardware
	\item Software
\end{itemize}

The main goal of this project is to create a system that a user can visually verify down
to the transistor level. The physical layout of the circuit should correspond to the
schematic drawing layout where possible.
